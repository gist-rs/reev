# Issues

## 🎯 Current Status - All Critical Issues Resolved

### ✅ **API Architecture Verification Complete**
- **Issue #30**: Frontend API Calls Analysis - **RESOLVED** ✅
- **Issue #31**: Status/Trace Endpoints CLI Dependencies - **RESOLVED** ✅
- **Issue #29**: API Architecture Fix - Remove CLI Dependency - **RESOLVED** ✅

### 🏆 **Architecture Achievements**
- **Zero CLI conflicts** during frontend load and API discovery
- **Database-only operations** for all status, trace, and sync endpoints
- **CLI usage isolated** to intentional benchmark execution only
- **Fast response times** with direct database queries
- **Server stability** - no crashes or cargo conflicts

### 📊 **Verified Endpoints**
**Auto-called on App Load (All Safe):**
- ✅ `/api/v1/health` - Health check
- ✅ `/api/v1/benchmarks` - Database discovery
- ✅ `/api/v1/agent-performance` - Database queries

**Status/Trace Operations (All DB-only):**
- ✅ `/api/v1/benchmarks/{id}/status/{execution_id}` - DB read
- ✅ `/api/v1/benchmarks/{id}/status` - DB read
- ✅ `/api/v1/flows/{session_id}` - DB read + file fallback
- ✅ `/api/v1/execution-logs/{benchmark_id}` - DB read
- ✅ `/api/v1/flow-logs/{benchmark_id}` - DB read
- ✅ `/api/v1/transaction-logs/{benchmark_id}` - DB read

**Sync Operations (File System + DB):**
- ✅ `/api/v1/sync` - File system scan + DB upsert (no CLI)
- ✅ `/api/v1/upsert-yml` - Database operations

**Execution Operations (CLI Intended):**
- ⚠️ `/api/v1/benchmarks/{id}/run` - **CLI/Runner** (intentional execution)

### 🔧 **Key Implementation**
- **CLI-based Runner**: Process isolation for benchmark execution
- **Database Discovery**: Fast, conflict-free benchmark listing
- **State Management**: Cross-process execution tracking via database
- **Error Handling**: Robust timeout and failure recovery

### ✅ **RESOLVED Issue - #32** 
### ✅ **All Critical Issues Resolved**

### 🎆 **Latest Achievement - Issue #32 Complete**
- **Title**: Database connection locks + Session file feedback loop missing  
- **Status**: **RESOLVED** ✅ - Database-free runner + session file feedback loop implemented
- **Key Fixes**:
  - ✅ Removed all database operations from reev-runner
  - ✅ Implemented session file reading in BenchmarkExecutor
  - ✅ Added pre-built binary support for fast CLI execution
  - ✅ API database access working independently
  - ✅ End-to-end execution flow functional

### 🏗️ **Target Architecture Achieved**
```
✨ IMPLEMENTED STATE:
Frontend → API Server → Database (all operations)
            ↓                  ✅ Session file feedback loop working  
CLI/Runner (db-free) → Session Files → API reads → Database storage

**Completed**: 
1. ✅ No database lock conflicts between API and runner
2. ✅ Session files created and successfully read by API
3. ✅ Execution state updates from "Running" → "Completed"/"Failed"
```

### 🎯 **Solution Implemented**
**Two-Phase Fix:**

**Phase 1: Prevent Database Conflicts** ✅
1. ✅ Removed all database operations from reev-runner
2. ✅ Runner only writes session files to `logs/sessions/`
3. ✅ API handles all database operations exclusively

**Phase 2: Complete Feedback Loop** ✅
1. ✅ Added session file reading to `BenchmarkExecutor.execute_cli_benchmark()` after CLI completion
2. ✅ Poll for `logs/sessions/session_{execution_id}.json` with retry logic
3. ✅ Parse session JSON to extract `final_result.success` and `final_result.score`
4. ✅ Update in-memory `execution_state` with actual results
5. ✅ Store final state in database via API (no runner DB conflicts)

### 🔧 **Implementation Complete**
- [✅] Identified database lock contention as root cause
- [✅] Removed database dependency from BenchmarkExecutor
- [✅] Fixed database column indices in `row_to_execution_state()`
- [✅] Implemented session file reading in `BenchmarkExecutor.read_session_file_results()`
- [✅] Removed all database operations from reev-runner (database-free runner)
- [✅] Added pre-built binary support for fast CLI execution
- [✅] Re-enabled database storage in API handlers (success cases only)
- [✅] Tested end-to-end execution with session file feedback loop
- [✅] Verified session files are read and parsed correctly
- [✅] Confirmed final state stored in database without conflicts

### 📊 **Implementation Details**
- **Database-Free Runner**: Completely removed database operations from reev-runner
- **Session Location**: `logs/sessions/session_{execution_id}.json` (working ✅)
- **Key Fields**: `final_result.success`, `final_result.score`, `execution_id`
- **Runner Command**: Pre-built `./target/release/reev-runner benchmarks/{file}.yml --agent={type}`
- **Session Reading**: `BenchmarkExecutor.read_session_file_results()` with retry logic
- **Database Storage**: API handles all database operations exclusively
