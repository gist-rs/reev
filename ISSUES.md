### #22 Execution Trace ASCII Tree Regression - RESOLVED ✅
**Description:** When refreshing or clicking "Execution Trace", the UI shows raw JSON output instead of the expected ASCII tree format that appears after completing a run.

**Root Cause:** The `get_execution_trace` function in `execution_logs.rs` was returning raw JSON content instead of using the `format_execution_trace` function to format it into ASCII tree display.

**Files Modified:**
- `crates/reev-api/src/handlers/execution_logs.rs` - Added formatting calls and helper function

**Solution:** Updated the execution trace handler to use the existing `format_execution_trace` function for both running and completed executions, with fallback to raw JSON if formatting fails.

**Acceptance Criteria:** ✅ Execution Trace now displays ASCII tree format consistently


### #21 BenchmarkList Date Sorting and Display Fix - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Closed  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: BenchmarkList component wasn't showing benchmarks sorted by date, and clicking boxes from BenchmarkGrid displayed wrong dates for the whole list.

**Root Cause**: 
1. BenchmarkList displayed benchmarks in original API order without sorting
2. getBenchmarkStatus function wasn't preserving timestamp data properly
3. No date indicator in the UI to show what the list is sorted by

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Added date sorting**: Benchmark items now sorted by most recent execution timestamp
2. **Fixed timestamp preservation**: Ensured historicalResults and getBenchmarkStatus preserve timestamp data
3. **Added date range indicator**: Shows date range (e.g., "Oct 20, 2025 - Oct 28, 2025") beside "Benchmarks" title

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Sorting logic - newest first
.sort((a, b) => {
  const aExecution = getBenchmarkStatus(a.id);
  const bExecution = getBenchmarkStatus(b.id);
  const aTimestamp = aExecution?.timestamp || "";
  const bTimestamp = bExecution?.timestamp || "";
  
  if (aTimestamp && bTimestamp) {
    return new Date(bTimestamp).getTime() - new Date(aTimestamp).getTime();
  }
  // Fallback logic for missing timestamps
});

// Date range display
const dateRange = earliestTimestamp && latestTimestamp 
  ? `(${earliestDate} - ${latestDate})` 
  : latestTimestamp 
    ? `(${latestDate})` 
    : "(no executions)";
```

**Files Modified**: 
- `web/src/components/BenchmarkList.tsx` - Added sorting logic, timestamp preservation, and date range display

**Verification**: 
- ✅ Build successful: `npm run build` completed without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript diagnostics issues
- ✅ Benchmarks now display sorted by latest execution date
- ✅ Date range indicator shows relevant time period
- ✅ Fixed wrong date display when clicking from BenchmarkGrid

### #20 Web Benchmark History State Loading Bug - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Closed  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: When finishing benchmark runs on web, there was problematic history state loading logic that interfered with the run complete state display.

**Root Cause**: In `handleBenchmarkSelect()` function, when no current execution was found, the system would attempt to load historical execution data from database via API call `/api/v1/benchmarks/${benchmarkId}/status?agent=${selectedAgent}`. This caused confusion between current execution state and historical data.

**Fix Applied**: Removed the entire history state loading logic section and simplified to only set current execution directly:
```typescript
// Before: Complex async history loading with fallbacks
// After: Simple direct execution setting
setCurrentExecution(execution || null);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Eliminated state confusion between current and historical executions  
- ✅ Cleaner benchmark completion handling
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary API calls
- ✅ Immediate display of run complete state without history interference

**Files Modified**: 
- `web/src/index.tsx` - Lines 145-193 (removed history loading logic)

**Verification**: 
- ✅ Build successful: `npm run build` completed without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript diagnostics issues
- ✅ Simplified state management for benchmark execution

### #19 Jupiter Swap Tool Response Format Inconsistency - CRITICAL 🔥

**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Description**: Same benchmark (`200-jup-swap-then-lend-deposit`) succeeds via CLI (100% score) but fails via API due to Jupiter swap tools returning different response formats between execution paths.

**Analysis**: Root cause identified as Jupiter swap tool response format inconsistency between CLI and API execution paths. However, discovered that API path is not using flow system at all, but regular enhanced agent system.

**Current Investigation Status**:
- ✅ **CLI Path**: Uses same `run_flow_benchmark()` function as API
- ✅ **API Path**: Uses same `run_flow_benchmark()` function as CLI  
- ❌ **Core Issue**: API Step 2 receives `amount=0` instead of correct swap result amount
- ✅ **API Process Fix**: Set `kill_api=false` to prevent API from killing itself

**Root Cause Identified**:
Step result communication from Step 1 → Step 2 fails in API mode. Both paths call same `run_flow_benchmark()` function but:
- **CLI**: Step 2 gets correct amount from Step 1 result (e.g., 394358118 USDC)
- **API**: Step 2 gets wrong amount (0) - agent context missing step results

**Critical Bug Location**:
In `run_flow_benchmark()`, step prompts are passed without enrichment from previous step results:
```rust
let step_test_case = TestCase {
    id: format!("{}-step-{}", test_case.id, step.step),
    prompt: step.prompt.clone(), // ← Original prompt only, no Step 1 context!
    // ...
};
```

**Missing Feature**: Step 2 prompt should be enriched with Step 1 results (swap amount) but currently only gets original prompt.

**Investigation Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- Need to identify why same `run_flow_benchmark()` behaves differently for CLI vs API
- Need to implement prompt enrichment with previous step results for flow execution
- Both CLI and API should receive identical step context and produce same results

**Files Under Investigation**:
- `crates/reev-runner/src/lib.rs` - `run_flow_benchmark()` function 
- `crates/reev-agent/src/flow/agent.rs` - FlowAgent with proper context handling
- Step context building mechanism between flow steps

**Key Logic Flow Difference Found**:
- CLI: Successfully gets swap result amount `394358118` (394.358 USDC) from step 1
- API: Uses wrong amount `1000000000` (1000 USDC) - fails with insufficient funds
- Both show `Tokens: 0` in step 2 context, but CLI bypasses this limitation

**Root Cause**: Step result communication from step 1 → step 2 works in CLI but fails in API

**Investigation Needed**:
1. How `step_1_result` is passed to step 2 context in CLI vs API
2. Why swap result `output_amount: 394358118` reaches CLI prompt but not API
3. Context building difference: CLI includes swap result in step 2 context, API doesn't
4. Flow execution path difference between CLI and API for step dependencies

**Critical Files to Compare**:
- `crates/reev-agent/src/flow/state.rs` - `format_step_results()` implementation
- `crates/reev-agent/src/flow/agent.rs` - `enrich_prompt()` step result handling  
- API benchmark runner vs CLI runner step dependency resolution

**Not Jupiter Earn Tool Issue**: Both correctly use `jupiter_lend_earn_deposit` tool - this is tool response format inconsistency, not earn vs deposit tool confusion.

### #18 Jupiter Earn Tool Regression in Normal Mode - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Closed  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: The `jupiter_earn` tool was incorrectly available in normal agent mode, allowing benchmarks like `116-jup-lend-redeem-usdc.yml` to access position/earnings data instead of executing proper redeem transactions.

**Root Cause**: 
1. OpenAI agent normal mode was adding `jupiter_earn_tool` to all tools
2. ZAI agent was returning `true` for all tools when `allowed_tools` was `None`

**Fix Applied**:
1. **OpenAI Agent**: Removed `.tool(tools.jupiter_earn_tool)` from normal mode tool list
2. **ZAI Agent**: Added explicit restriction to return `false` for `jupiter_earn` when `allowed_tools` is `None`

**Result**: 
- Before: Step 2 failed with "Agent returned no actions to execute" (75% score)
- After: Both steps succeed with proper Jupiter lend/redeem transactions (100% score)

**Security**: Maintained architecture rule that `jupiter_earn` tool is restricted to position/earnings benchmarks (114-*.yml) only.

**Files Modified**: 
- `crates/reev-agent/src/enhanced/openai.rs` - Line 208
- `crates/reev-agent/src/enhanced/zai_agent.rs` - Line 88-95

### #17 GLM Context Leaking to Non-GLM Models - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Closed  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: `is_glm` flag was incorrectly set to `true` for ALL non-deterministic models when GLM environment was available, not just for GLM models.

**Root Cause**: 
- Logic was: `is_glm = agent_name != "deterministic"` in GLM environment path
- Logic was: `is_glm = glm_env_available && agent_name != "deterministic"` in fallback path  
- This meant local, jupiter, and other models were incorrectly getting GLM parsing

**Fix Applied**: Modified logic to `is_glm = agent_name.starts_with("glm")` in both paths, ensuring:
- ✅ **GLM models** (glm-4.6, glm-coding, etc.) → `is_glm = true` 
- ✅ **Deterministic agent** → `is_glm = false` (no GLM context knowledge)
- ✅ **Other models** (local, jupiter, etc.) → `is_glm = false`

**Testing Verified**:
- ✅ Deterministic agent: 100% score, no GLM parsing
- ✅ GLM-4.6 agent: 100% score, proper GLM parsing  
- ✅ Local agent: runs without GLM context
- ✅ Fallback chain: `GLM -> Jupiter -> Deterministic -> Standard`

**Files Modified**: `crates/reev-lib/src/llm_agent.rs` - Lines 65 and 110

### #16 API vs CLI Deterministic Agent Testing Issue - IDENTIFIED ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Need comprehensive testing procedure and verification details for deterministic agent fix.

**Testing Required**:
- Verify deterministic parser works consistently in both CLI and API
- Test fallback chain: GLM -> Jupiter -> Deterministic -> Standard  
- Validate deterministic parser detection logic
- Test edge cases and error handling

**How to Test**:
```bash
# Unit tests for deterministic parser
cargo test -p reev-lib deterministic_parser -- --nocapture

# Integration test via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/benchmarks/001-sol-transfer/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent": "deterministic"}'

# Check result
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/v1/benchmarks/001-sol-transfer/status/<execution_id> \
  | jq '.status, (.trace | test("Score: 100.0%"))'

# Debug deterministic parser
grep -A 5 -B 5 "DeterministicParser" logs/reev-api.log

# Test deterministic agent directly
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9090/gen/tx?mock=true \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"001-sol-transfer","context_prompt":"test"}' | jq .
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ **Status**: `"Completed"`
- ✅ **Score**: `"Score: 100.0%"` 
- ✅ **Trace**: Should show successful SOL transfer execution
- ✅ **Transactions**: Should extract 1 instruction from `result.text`

**Debugging Checklist**:
- Check if `DeterministicParser] Parsing deterministic agent response` appears in logs
- Verify fallback chain order: GLM -> Jupiter -> Deterministic -> Standard
- Check response format from reev-agent matches expected structure
- Validate that `result.text` is properly deserialized to `Vec<RawInstruction>`

**Files to Monitor**:
- `logs/reev-api.log`: API execution and parsing logs
- `logs/reev-agent_deterministic_*.log`: Deterministic agent responses
- `crates/reev-lib/src/parsing/deterministic_parser.rs`: Core parsing logic

**Refer to**: `HANDOVER.md` for detailed implementation status and debugging procedures

## Recent Resolved Issues

### #15 Deterministic Parser Architecture Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Closed  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Deterministic agent parsing was mixed into general parsing module causing architectural confusion and maintenance issues.

**Root Cause**: 
- Deterministic agent has specific response format: `{result: {text: Vec<RawInstruction>}, transactions: null}`
- Parser logic was becoming complex with multiple special cases mixed together
- Hard to maintain and test deterministic parsing separately
- Risk of regression when fixing other parser types

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Created dedicated `crates/reev-lib/src/parsing/deterministic_parser.rs` module
- ✅ Moved deterministic-specific logic out of shared `parsing/mod.rs`
- ✅ Kept deterministic agent parsing isolated and testable
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns between parser types
- ✅ Updated fallback mechanism: GLM -> Jupiter -> Deterministic -> Standard

**Files Modified**:
- `crates/reev-lib/src/parsing/mod.rs`: Added deterministic parser to fallback chain
- `crates/reev-lib/src/parsing/deterministic_parser.rs`: New dedicated module with tests

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Deterministic parser now isolated and testable
- ✅ No more special cases cluttering main parsing module
- ✅ Easier to maintain deterministic parsing logic
- ✅ Clear architectural boundaries
- ✅ Dedicated tests for deterministic parsing

**Status**: Implementation complete, working in production

### #12 Critical Session ID Collision - IDENTIFIED ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Description**: Sequential benchmark runs overwrite each other's log files due to session_id collision

**Root Cause**: FlowLogger::with_database() generates NEW UUID instead of preserving existing session_id

**Fix Status**: 🔧 IMPLEMENTED - Fix applied but requires verification testing

## Recent Resolved Issues

### #14 Deterministic Agent API Parsing Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Closed  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Deterministic agent worked in CLI execution (100% score) but failed in API execution (0% score) due to response parsing mismatch.

**Root Cause**: Response parsing discrepancy between CLI and API paths:
- CLI used GLM-style parsing (is_glm=true) which correctly extracts transactions from result.text field
- API used standard parsing (is_glm=false) which couldn't find instructions in deterministic agent's response format

**Fix Applied**: Modified LlmAgent in `reev-lib/src/llm_agent.rs` to set `is_glm=true` for deterministic agent regardless of environment variables, ensuring consistent parsing behavior.

**Verification**: 
✅ CLI: Still works perfectly (Score: 100.0%)
✅ API: Now works perfectly (Score: 100.0%)

**Key Learning**: Deterministic agent returns responses in GLM-compatible format (result.text containing JSON instructions), requiring GLM-style parser even though it's not actually a GLM model.

### #13 Empty Log Files - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Closed  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Description**: All benchmark log files were empty across all benchmark executions. reev-runner could not open log files for any process (reev-agent, surfpool), causing immediate benchmark failures.

**Root Cause**: `OpenOptions::new().append(true).open()` fails when file doesn't exist - missing `.create(true)` flag.

**Fix Applied**: Added `.create(true)` flag to ProcessManager for stdout/stderr file creation.

**Verification**: ✅ Log files now created and contain proper output for both reev-agent and surfpool processes.

### #11 Jupiter Lend Deposit Amount Parsing Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Closed  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Jupiter lend deposit benchmark was parsing wrong amount from context (1000 SOL instead of 0.01 SOL).

**Root Cause**: Incorrect amount extraction logic in Jupiter lending handlers.

**Fix Applied**: Fixed amount parsing to correctly extract 0.01 SOL for deposit operations.

### #10 Jupiter Earn Tool Scope Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Closed  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Jupiter earn tool was being used outside of position/earnings benchmarks (114-*.yml), violating security rules.

**Fix Applied**: Restricted jupiter_earn tool to only position/earnings benchmarks (114-*.yml) as per security requirements.

### #9 SPL Transfer Uses Wrong Recipient Address - RESOLVED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-27
