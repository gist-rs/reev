## üìã **PHASE 5: CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT (New Requirement)**
**Goal**: Provide LLM with prerequisite wallet/account context to reduce unnecessary tool calls

### **Problem Identified**
- LLM currently calls `jupiter_earn.positions` to check before acting (smart but consumes depth)
- All account balance and token information is available in benchmark YAML files
- LLM shouldn't need to "discover" information that's already provided in setup
- Need two scenarios: (1) with context for direct action, (2) without extended depth for discovery

### **Context Enhancement Tasks**

**Phase 5.1: Parse Account Information from YAML**
- [ ] Create context builder module: `crates/reev-agent/src/context/`
- [ ] Parse `initial_state` from benchmark YAML files
- [ ] Extract token account balances and positions
- [ ] Format account information for LLM context

**Phase 5.2: Context Integration**
- [ ] Update enhanced agents to include context in system prompt
- [ ] Format as structured account information:
  ```
  USER_WALLET_PUBKEY: 5 SOL balance
  USER_USDC_ATA: 100 USDC balance  
  USER_L_USDC_ATA: 50 L-USDC shares (Solend position)
  ```
- [ ] Include token mint addresses and amounts

**Phase 5.3: Two-Tier Depth Strategy**
- [ ] **With Context**: Use normal depth (3) when account info provided
- [ ] **Without Context**: Use extended depth (5-7) for discovery scenarios
- [ ] Detect context availability and adjust conversation depth accordingly
- [ ] Create benchmarks for both scenarios to validate approach

**Phase 5.4: Smart Tool Selection**
- [ ] Update tool descriptions to reference available context
- [ ] Add "if you don't see account info below, check positions first"
- [ ] Optimize LLM decision-making based on provided context

### **Expected Benefits**
- Reduce unnecessary tool calls by 60-80%
- Higher success rates for direct action scenarios
- Better LLM understanding of user's current financial position
- Support for both informed and discovery use cases
- More natural conversation flow

### **Implementation Priority**
1. **HIGH**: Phase 5.1-5.2 (Context parsing and integration)
2. **MEDIUM**: Phase 5.3 (Two-tier depth strategy)
3. **LOW**: Phase 5.4 (Tool description optimization)

## üìã **PHASE 6-7: COMPLETION & DOCUMENTATION**
*(Existing phases 5-7 from original plan)*

**Phase 6: Testing and Validation**
- [ ] Test new context-enhanced LLM agents
- [ ] Compare performance: with vs without context
- [ ] Validate both depth strategies work correctly
- [ ] Ensure no regressions in existing benchmarks

**Phase 7: Documentation Updates**
- [ ] Update `TOFIX.md` with context enhancement results
- [ ] Update `REFLECT.md` with LLM behavior insights
- [ ] Document two-tier depth strategy for future reference
- [ ] Create best practices guide for context design

## üéØ **NEW EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

### **After Context Enhancement:**
- **With Context**: Direct action, minimal tool calls, high success rates
- **Without Context**: Extended depth for discovery, robust fallback behavior  
- **Intelligent Adaptation**: LLM adjusts approach based on available information
- **Improved Efficiency**: 60-80% reduction in unnecessary API calls
- **Better Conversations**: More natural LLM interactions with financial context

### **Performance Targets:**
- Direct action scenarios: 95%+ success with 1-2 tool calls
- Discovery scenarios: 85%+ success with 3-5 tool calls
- Overall benchmark improvement: 15-25% higher scores
- Reduced MaxDepthError instances: 90% reduction

---

### **Key Principle Evolved:**
Provide LLM with necessary context upfront, but build robust discovery mechanisms for when context is incomplete.
