## Ground Truth Data Separation - Critical Architecture Fix âœ… COMPLETED

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue Fixed
**Problem**: FlowAgent was passing `benchmark.ground_truth` into `resolve_initial_context()`, leaking future information and breaking real-time multi-step decision making.

**Solution Implemented**: Added clean ground truth separation with mode detection
- âœ… Deterministic mode: Uses ground truth for reproducible tests
- âœ… LLM mode: Uses real blockchain state only (no leakage)
- âœ… Validation: Prevents ground truth usage in LLM mode

## Enhanced Tool Call Logging âœ… COMPLETED

### Issue Analysis
The "Calling tool sol_transfer" logs appeared in reev-agent.log but tool calls weren't being stored in the database session_tool_calls table. This created a gap where tool execution data was being captured in memory but lost during session completion.

### Root Cause Discovery
1. **Process Separation**: reev-runner and reev-agent run in separate processes
2. **Independent Logger Instances**: Each process has its own ENHANCED_OTEL_LOGGER static
3. **Wrong Instance Access**: reev-runner was checking its own empty logger instead of agent's populated logger

### Solution Implemented
Modified reev-runner to extract tool calls from agent's enhanced otel log files:

1. **Cross-Process Communication**: Runner reads otel_*.json files from logs/sessions directory
2. **JSON Parsing**: Extracts EnhancedToolCall entries from each file
3. **Database Storage**: Stores extracted tool calls in session_tool_calls table with proper session association

### Verification Results
âœ… **Tool calls successfully captured**: 8 sol_transfer tool calls extracted and stored
âœ… **Database storage working**: Verified with SQLite query showing entries
âœ… **End-to-end flow working**: From agent tool execution â†’ enhanced logging â†’ file storage â†’ runner extraction â†’ database storage

### Technical Changes Made
- **Added extract_tool_calls_from_agent_logs()** function to reev-runner/src/lib.rs
- **Modified session completion logic** to call this function instead of get_enhanced_otel_logger()
- **Enhanced tool call logging macros** added to reev-flow/src/enhanced_otel.rs
- **Tool execution integration** in reev-tools/src/tools/native.rs now uses enhanced logging

**Fixed Code**:
```rust
// ðŸŽ¯ CAPTURE TOOL CALLS FROM AGENT'S ENHANCED OTEL LOG FILES
// Since reev-agent runs in separate process, we need to read from its otel log files
let tool_calls = extract_tool_calls_from_agent_logs(&session_id).await;

if !tool_calls.is_empty() {
    info!(
        session_id = %session_id,
        tool_calls_count = tool_calls.len(),
        "Storing tool calls in database (from agent log files)"
    );

    for tool_call in &tool_calls {
        let tool_data = reev_db::writer::sessions::ToolCallData {
            session_id: session_id.clone(),
            tool_name: tool_call.tool_name.clone(),
            start_time: tool_call.timestamp.timestamp() as u64,
            execution_time_ms: tool_call.execution_time_ms,
            input_params: tool_call.input_params.clone(),
            output_result: tool_call.output_result.clone(),
            status: match tool_call.status {
                reev_flow::ToolExecutionStatus::Success => "success".to_string(),
                reev_flow::ToolExecutionStatus::Error => "error".to_string(),
                reev_flow::ToolExecutionStatus::Timeout => "timeout".to_string(),
            },
            error_message: tool_call.error_message.clone(),
            metadata: Some(tool_call.metadata.clone()),
        };

        if let Err(e) = db.store_tool_call(&tool_data).await {
            warn!(
                session_id = %session_id,
                tool_name = %tool_call.tool_name,
                error = %e,
                "Failed to store tool call in database"
            );
        }
    }
} else {
    debug!("No tool calls found in agent log files");
}
```

**Fixed Code**:
```rust
// In FlowAgent - Proper ground truth separation
let ground_truth_for_context =
    if is_deterministic_mode(&self.model_name, &benchmark.id, &benchmark.tags) {
        info!("[FlowAgent] Using ground truth for deterministic mode");
        Some(&benchmark.ground_truth)
    } else {
        info!("[FlowAgent] Using real blockchain state for LLM mode");
        None // LLM gets actual chain state, no future info leakage
    };

// Validate no ground truth leakage in LLM mode
if !is_deterministic_mode(&self.model_name, &benchmark.id, &benchmark.tags)
    && !benchmark.ground_truth.final_state_assertions.is_empty() {
    return Err(anyhow!(
        "Ground truth not allowed in LLM mode - would leak future information"
    ));
}
```
