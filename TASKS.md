# Reev Core Implementation Tasks

## End-to-End Testing

### How to Run the End-to-End Swap Test

We've created a filtered logging test that follows the 6-step process:

1. Prompt: "swap 1 SOL for USDC"
2. YML prompt with wallet info from SURFPOOL sent to GLM-coding via ZAI_API_KEY
3. Swap tool calling from LLM
4. Generated transaction
5. Transaction signed with default keypair at ~/.config/solana/id.json
6. Transaction completion result from SURFPOOL

#### Running with Filtered Logs

To reduce noise and focus on the expected output, run the test with:

```bash
# Using the script (recommended)
./scripts/run_swap_test.sh

# Or manually with RUST_LOG filtering
RUST_LOG=reev_core::planner=info,reev_core::executor=info,jup_sdk=info,warn cargo test -p reev-core --test end_to_end_swap test_swap_1_sol_for_usdc -- --nocapture --ignored
```

#### Running the "sell all SOL" Test

```bash
# Using the script (recommended)
./scripts/run_sell_all_test.sh

# Or manually with RUST_LOG filtering
RUST_LOG=reev_core::planner=info,reev_core::executor=info,jup_sdk=info,warn cargo test -p reev-core --test end_to_end_swap test_sell_all_sol_for_usdc -- --nocapture --ignored
```

#### Prerequisites

1. SURFPOOL must be installed and running on port 8899
2. ZAI_API_KEY must be set in your .env file
3. Default Solana keypair must exist at ~/.config/solana/id.json


## Recent Critical Fix

### ✅ End-to-End Swap Test Implementation
Fixed critical issue where LLM was being asked to generate complex YAML structures including UUIDs. Now:
- LLM only extracts intent and parameters from user prompt
- Planner generates flow structure programmatically with proper UUIDs
- Connected to existing ZAI provider implementation
- Test now runs through to Jupiter swap execution

## 🎯 **Why: Third Implementation with Code Reuse**

This is our third implementation attempt of verifiable AI-generated DeFi flows architecture. We have working code in previous implementations that must be reused - not migrated or rewritten. The goal is to consolidate working functionality into new architecture outlined in PLAN_CORE_V2.md.

## 🔄 **Current Implementation Status**

```
User Prompt → [reev-core/planner] → YML Flow → [reev-core/executor] → Tool Calls → [reev-orchestrator] → Execution
```

### Two-Phase LLM Approach Status
- ✅ **Phase 1 (Refine+Plan)**: Connected to GLM-4.6-coding model via ZAI API
- ✅ **Phase 2 (Tool Execution)**: Connected to real tool implementations with proper error handling
- ✅ **YML as Structured Prompt**: Parseable, auditable flow definitions implemented

### Test Results
- ✅ **reev-core Unit Tests**: All 8 tests passing
- ✅ **reev-orchestrator Unit Tests**: All 17 tests passing
- ✅ **reev-orchestrator Integration Tests**: All 10 tests passing

## 🔄 **Current Implementation Status**

```
User Prompt → [reev-core/planner] → YML Flow → [reev-core/executor] → Tool Calls → [reev-orchestrator] → Execution
```
