# üéØ Issues to Fix - CURRENT ACTIVE ISSUES

## üö® HIGH PRIORITY (Production Impact)

### 1. Multi-Step Flow Position Checking Issue
**Status**: üîÑ ACTIVE ISSUE
**Location**: Multi-step flow benchmarks (Step 2+ operations)
**Impact**: Redeem/withdraw operations fail despite successful mint operations

#### Problem Description
In benchmark `116-jup-lend-redeem-usdc`, local LLM agent fails with architectural mismatch:
- **Step 1**: ‚úÖ FIXED - MaxDepthError resolved, agent successfully mints jUSDC tokens
- **Step 2**: ‚ùå Position checking failure - agent calls `jupiter_earn` which queries real mainnet
- **Root Cause**: Surfpool fork operations don't exist on Jupiter's mainnet API
- **Result**: Position check returns 0 shares, causing redeem operation to fail

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Step 1 success confirms infrastructure** - MaxDepthError fix proves tools and prompting work correctly
- **Architectural design flaw**: Flow operations execute in surfpool fork, but position checking queries real mainnet
- **Agent behavior is correct**: Agent is properly following position check ‚Üí redeem workflow
- **Data synchronization issue**: No bridge between surfpool state and Jupiter's mainnet API
- **Multi-step complexity**: Step 2 needs context from Step 1 that isn't available through external APIs

#### Current Error States
1. **‚úÖ RESOLVED**: MaxDepthError - Agent no longer gets stuck in infinite loops
2. **‚ùå ACTIVE**: Position Data Mismatch - Jupiter API returns 0 positions for surfpool operations
3. **‚ùå ACTIVE**: ToolCallError - Redeem tool fails with "Shares must be greater than 0"
4. **Architecture Conflict**: Position checking incompatible with surfpool fork environment

#### Evidence from Logs
```
Agent Response: "Based on the updated position data, I can confirm that you have zero jUSDC shares"
Expected: Skip position check in flows, use known amount from Step 1
Actual: Correctly calls jupiter_earn tool, but gets real mainnet data (0 positions)
Jupiter API: Returns 0 positions (correct - minting happened in surfpool fork)
Result: Redeem tool called with shares=0, fails validation
```

#### Files Affected
- `crates/reev-agent/src/flow/agent.rs` - FlowAgent tool management and prompting
- `crates/reev-agent/src/tools/jupiter_earn.rs` - Position checking tool
- `crates/reev-agent/src/enhanced/openai.rs` - LLM agent tool calling logic
- `crates/reev-agent/src/run.rs` - Agent routing and error handling

#### Solution Required
1. **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Agent Loop Fix - MaxDepthError completely resolved
2. **Flow-Aware Tool Filtering**: Conditional tool availability for multi-step flows
3. **Context State Management**: Pass Step 1 results (minted amounts) to Step 2
4. **Skip Position Checking**: Force direct execution in flows using known amounts
5. **Architecture Alignment**: Ensure all operations use same data source (surfpool)

#### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Local LLM agent completes Step 1 without hitting depth limits (ACHIEVED)
- Local LLM agent completes Step 2 using context from Step 1 (PENDING)
- Agent skips position checking in multi-step flows (PENDING)
- Flow benchmarks complete successfully with local agents (PENDING)
- Consistent behavior between deterministic and local agents (PENDING)

## üìù Notes

This issue represents the last remaining production-impacting problem in the reev framework. Once resolved, the framework will achieve 100% production readiness across all agent types.

The deterministic agent's perfect performance confirms that all underlying infrastructure (Jupiter integration, flow execution, scoring) is working correctly. The issue is specifically in the LLM agent's tool-calling behavior, which is a well-understood problem in LLM agent systems.

Priority should be given to this fix as it affects the evaluation of local LLM agents, which is a core capability of the framework.
