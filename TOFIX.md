# Development Improvements

## Performance & Development Experience

### Better Development Workflow with Cargo Watch

**Current Issue**: During development, `cargo run -p reev-runner` compiles the runner from scratch every time (30-60s), making testing very slow.

**Solution**: Make `cargo watch` the default during development and add a flag to use release binaries when needed.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Update BenchmarkExecutor**: Add `--use-release` flag support
2. **Default Development Mode**: Use `cargo watch` for fast recompilation
3. **Production Mode**: Use pre-built release binaries for maximum performance
4. **Seamless Switching**: Automatic fallback between development and production modes

#### Benefits:
- üöÄ **Fast Development**: Near-instant recompilation during development
- ‚ö° **Production Performance**: Release binaries for actual testing
- üîÑ **Seamless Workflow**: No manual intervention needed
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Friendly**: No more waiting 30-60s for runner compilation

#### Technical Details:
```rust
// In BenchmarkExecutor - add release mode support
let use_release = std::env::var("REEV_USE_RELEASE").unwrap_or_else(|_| "false".to_string()) == "true";

let runner_command = if use_release && Path::new("./target/release/reev-runner").exists() {
    "./target/release/reev-runner".to_string()
} else {
    // Use cargo watch for development (default)
    "cargo watch -x \"run -p reev-runner\"".to_string()
};
```

### Enhanced OTEL Logging

**Current State**: Enhanced OpenTelemetry logging exists but may not be optimally configured.

**Improvement Opportunities**:
1. **Environment Configuration**: Make enhanced OTEL the default for better debugging
2. **Performance Metrics**: Add execution time and success rate tracking
3. **Log Rotation**: Prevent large log files from accumulating
4. **Structured Logging**: Better JSON formatting for analysis tools

#### Configuration:
```bash
# Enable enhanced OTEL by default
export REEV_ENHANCED_OTEL_FILE="logs/sessions/enhanced_otel_{session_id}.jsonl"

# Use release mode for production testing
export REEV_USE_RELEASE="true"
```

### Development Experience

**Current Pain Points**:
- Long compilation times during testing
- Manual cleanup of processes
- Inconsistent logging between development and production
- Session file cleanup not automated

**Solutions**:
1. **Automatic Process Management**: Smart process cleanup in scripts
2. **Consistent Logging**: Same logging format in dev and prod
3. **Better Error Messages**: More descriptive error reporting
4. **Session Cleanup**: Automated old session file removal
5. **Hot Reload**: File watching for configuration changes

These improvements will make development much faster and more enjoyable! üöÄ
