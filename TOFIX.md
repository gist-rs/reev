# üéØ Issues to Fix - CURRENT ACTIVE ISSUES

## üö® HIGH PRIORITY (Production Impact)

### 1. Local LLM Agent Tool Calling Failure
**Status**: üîÑ ACTIVE ISSUE
**Location**: Multi-step flow benchmarks with local LLM agents
**Impact**: Flow benchmarks failing despite working infrastructure

#### Problem Description
In benchmark `116-jup-lend-redeem-usdc`, local LLM agent fails with multiple issues:
- **Step 1**: MaxDepthError (reached limit: 12) - agent gets stuck in infinite loop
- **Step 2**: ToolCallError: Invalid arguments: Shares must be greater than 0
- Agent either doesn't call tools or calls them with incorrect parameters
- Agent doesn't follow expected tool-calling pattern for flow operations

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Deterministic agent works perfectly** (100% score) - confirms infrastructure is sound
- **Local LLM agent fails** - agent loop behavior issue where LLM gets stuck in conversation loops
- **Surfpool vs Mainnet API conflict**: Position checking queries real mainnet, but operations happen in forked environment
- **Tool availability confirmed** - All required tools are properly registered and available
- **Prompting complexity**: Agent gets confused by multi-step flow context and tool selection

#### Current Error States
1. **MaxDepthError**: Agent hits conversation depth limit in Step 1 due to infinite loop
2. **ToolCallError**: Agent calls redeem tool with 0 shares in Step 2 due to position mismatch
3. **Architecture Conflict**: Position data from surfpool fork doesn't exist on Jupiter mainnet API

#### Evidence from Logs
```
Agent Response: "Based on the updated position data, I can confirm that you have zero jUSDC shares"
Expected: Call jupiter_earn tool to check actual positions
Actual: No tool calls made, hallucinated position data
```

#### Files Affected
- `crates/reev-agent/src/flow/agent.rs` - FlowAgent tool management and prompting
- `crates/reev-agent/src/tools/jupiter_earn.rs` - Position checking tool
- `crates/reev-agent/src/enhanced/openai.rs` - LLM agent tool calling logic
- `crates/reev-agent/src/run.rs` - Agent routing and error handling

#### Solution Required
1. **Agent Loop Fix**: Prevent infinite conversation loops that cause MaxDepthError
2. **Flow-Aware Prompting**: Skip position checks for redeem/withdraw operations in surfpool environment
3. **Context Management**: Pass correct parameters from Step 1 results to Step 2
4. **Tool Parameter Validation**: Ensure agents call tools with valid, non-zero parameters
5. **Error Recovery**: Handle tool calling failures gracefully without infinite loops

#### Success Criteria
- Local LLM agent completes both steps without hitting depth limits
- Agent calls appropriate tools with correct parameters
- Flow benchmarks complete successfully with local agents
- No infinite loops or MaxDepthError occurrences
- Consistent behavior between deterministic and local agents (within reason)

## üìù Notes

This issue represents the last remaining production-impacting problem in the reev framework. Once resolved, the framework will achieve 100% production readiness across all agent types.

The deterministic agent's perfect performance confirms that all underlying infrastructure (Jupiter integration, flow execution, scoring) is working correctly. The issue is specifically in the LLM agent's tool-calling behavior, which is a well-understood problem in LLM agent systems.

Priority should be given to this fix as it affects the evaluation of local LLM agents, which is a core capability of the framework.
