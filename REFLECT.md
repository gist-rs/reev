## üìö Archived Debugging Sessions

### **Session 1: Major Regression Fix (Agent Architecture)**
*Historical context: Critical fix that restored AI agent from 56.2% to 100% success rate*

#### **Key Issues Resolved:**
- **MaxDepthError Masking**: Discovered and fixed incorrect error handling that was masking real agent failures
- **Tool Integration**: Fixed agent response format from conversational text to proper JSON tool outputs
- **Benchmark ID Consistency**: Resolved case mismatch issues between YAML files and agent expectations
- **Tool Implementation Bug**: Fixed SPL transfer tool recalculating recipient addresses instead of using agent-provided addresses

#### **Lessons Learned:**
- Never mask errors as success - let real issues surface for proper diagnosis
- Test both deterministic and AI agents to catch regressions
- Validate tool output matches agent parameters exactly
- Maintain consistency across all benchmark references

---

### **Session 2: Jupiter Integration Debugging**
*Historical context: Resolving public API vs local surfpool integration issues*

#### **Key Issues Resolved:**
- **Public API Problem**: Fixed agent making direct calls to Jupiter's public API instead of local surfpool
- **SDK Integration**: Replaced `reqwest` calls with proper `jup-sdk` integration for local environment
- **Mainnet Fork Requirements**: Ensured all operations work with real mainnet-forked state
- **Transaction Building**: Fixed SDK instruction format conversion to our internal `RawInstruction` format

#### **Lessons Learned:**
- Isolate test environments - never call public mainnet APIs from local tests
- Use official SDKs when available for proper context handling
- Log all API responses comprehensively to identify integration issues
- Validate that a "passing" score doesn't hide real transaction failures

---

### **Session 3: SOL Wrapping Requirements**
*Historical context: Understanding Jupiter lending protocol requirements for native SOL*

#### **Key Issues Resolved:**
- **Account Initialization**: Fixed missing WSOL ATA creation for native SOL deposits
- **Instruction Sequencing**: Moved prerequisite setup instructions from test helpers to agent logic
- **Self-Contained Agents**: Ensured deterministic agents generate complete instruction sequences
- **Protocol Requirements**: Documented Jupiter lending protocol requirements for future reference

#### **Lessons Learned:**
- Agent logic should be self-contained and generate complete instruction sequences
- Prerequisite steps (like wrapping SOL) should not be handled by test harness
- Understand on-chain program requirements before implementing protocol handlers
- Validate instruction sequences against actual program expectations

## The Fix: Complete Tool Architecture Overhaul

### 1. Fixed Agent Response Format

-   **Issue:** The AI agent was returning conversational text instead of JSON tool outputs
-   **Root Cause:** The `SYSTEM_PREAMBLE` was instructing the agent to generate raw JSON directly, conflicting with the tool-based architecture
-   **Solution:** Rewrote the preamble to focus on tool usage and returning only tool output JSON

### 2. Fixed Benchmark ID Case Mismatch

-   **Issue:** Error: "Coding agent does not support this id: '002-SPL-TRANSFER'"
-   **Root Cause:** Benchmark YAML files had uppercase IDs but the deterministic agent expected lowercase
-   **Solution:** Updated all benchmark IDs, test files, and coding agent references to use consistent lowercase

### 3. Fixed Tool Implementation Bug

-   **Issue:** Agent generated correct recipient ATA address but tool produced wrong address
-   **Root Cause:** The SPL transfer tool was recalculating the recipient's ATA instead of using the ATA provided by the agent
-   **Solution:** Modified the tool to use `recipient_pubkey` directly as the destination ATA

## Results: Perfect Restoration

### Before Fix:
-   **Deterministic Agent**: 100.0% ‚úÖ
-   **AI Agent**: 56.2% ‚ùå (masked by incorrect error handling)

### After Fix:
-   **Deterministic Agent**: 100.0% ‚úÖ
-   **AI Agent**: 100.0% ‚úÖ (true performance restored)

## Key Architectural Insights

### 1. Tool Integration is Working Perfectly

The AI agent correctly:
- ‚úÖ Uses tools with proper parameters
- ‚úÖ Returns JSON instead of conversational text
- ‚úÖ Handles multi-turn conversations
- ‚úÖ Uses resolved addresses from key_map
- ‚úÖ Generates structurally correct instructions

### 2. The Rig Framework is Solid

The `rig` framework successfully:
- ‚úÖ Manages tool calls and responses
- ‚úÖ Handles conversation depth
- ‚úÖ Returns proper tool output to the agent
- ‚úÖ Integrates seamlessly with our protocol handlers

### 3. Error Handling Must Be Precise

The MaxDepthError issue taught us that:
- ‚ùå Never mask errors as success
- ‚ùå Don't use workarounds that hide real problems
- ‚úÖ Let errors surface to identify real issues
- ‚úÖ Fix root causes rather than symptoms

## Architecture Validation

This regression fix validates that our tool-based agent architecture is fundamentally sound:

1. **Agent Layer**: LLM correctly selects tools and provides parameters
2. **Tool Layer**: Tools generate proper Solana instructions  
3. **Protocol Layer**: Protocol handlers create valid transactions
4. **Environment Layer**: Surfpool executes transactions correctly

The issue was never with the AI agent or the framework - it was with incorrect error handling and a tool implementation bug. Now that both are fixed, the system works perfectly.

## Future Best Practices

1. **Never Mask Errors**: Always let real errors surface to identify actual problems
2. **Test Both Agents**: Compare deterministic and AI agents to catch regressions
3. **Validate Tool Output**: Ensure tools use the exact parameters provided by agents
4. **Use Proper Prompts**: Align prompts with the tool-based architecture expectations
5. **Monitor Consistency**: Keep benchmark IDs and references consistent across the codebase

The successful fix demonstrates that our AI agent architecture is robust and capable of achieving perfect scores when properly implemented.

# Reflection on Debugging Session (110-jup-lend-deposit-sol)

This document outlines the fixes for a regression found in the `110-jup-lend-deposit-sol.yml` benchmark after a major refactoring. The issue stemmed from a placeholder implementation and a misunderstanding of on-chain program requirements.

## Summary of Failures and Fixes

### 1. Initial Failure: `Invalid base58 data`

-   **Symptom:** The `reev-runner` crashed with `Error: Invalid base58 data: deposit_100000000`.
-   **Root Cause:** After the refactor, the `handle_jupiter_deposit` function in `reev-agent/src/protocols/jupiter/lend_deposit.rs` contained a placeholder implementation. It was generating a fake instruction with `data: format!("deposit_{amount:?}")`, which is not a valid base58 string and was correctly rejected by the deserializer.
-   **Solution:** The placeholder logic was completely replaced with a real implementation using the `jup-sdk`. This involved initializing the `Jupiter` client, creating `DepositParams`, calling `.deposit(params).prepare_transaction_components().await`, and converting the resulting SDK instructions into the `RawInstruction` format used by the agent.

### 2. Second Failure: `AccountNotInitialized`

-   **Symptom:** After fixing the `base58` error, the benchmark ran but the transaction simulation failed with the error: `AnchorError caused by account: depositor_token_account. Error Code: AccountNotInitialized`.
-   **Root Cause:** Depositing native SOL into Jupiter's lend program requires the user to first wrap the SOL into WSOL. This involves creating an Associated Token Account (ATA) for WSOL, transferring the SOL amount to it, and syncing the native mint. This logic was present in the *integration test setup* (`prepare_jupiter_lend_deposit` in `helpers.rs`) but was missing from the actual deterministic agent's logic (`d_110_jup_lend_deposit_sol.rs`). The agent was only generating the final Jupiter `deposit` instruction, without the prerequisite setup instructions.
-   **Solution:** The responsibility for creating a complete and valid transaction was moved from the test helpers to the agent itself.
    1.  The SOL wrapping logic (creating the WSOL ATA, transferring SOL, and syncing the account) was moved from `reev-runner/tests/common/helpers.rs` into `reev-agent/src/agents/coding/d_110_jup_lend_deposit_sol.rs`.
    2.  The agent now constructs a transaction containing all three setup instructions followed by the Jupiter deposit instruction.
    3.  The test helper (`prepare_jupiter_lend_deposit`) was simplified, as it no longer needs to create these setup instructions.

## Key Takeaways and Future Best Practices

1.  **Isolate the Test Environment:** Tools designed for on-chain interactions within our test framework **must** communicate with the local `surfpool` RPC endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8899`). They should **never** call public mainnet APIs (`https://quote-api.jup.ag`, etc.), as the state will be inconsistent.

2.  **Leverage the Correct SDK:** When an SDK like `jup-sdk` is available and designed to work with `surfpool`, it should always be preferred over direct API calls. It correctly handles the context of the local forked environment.

3.  **Comprehensive Logging is Non-Negotiable:** The breakthrough in diagnosing the core issue came from logging the full JSON response from the external API call in the `reev-agent.log`. This revealed the `simulationError` and proved the problem was with the API interaction, not the agent's logic.

4.  **A "Passing" Score Isn't Always a Success:** A benchmark can run to completion and receive a high score (e.g., 75%) even if the on-chain transaction fails. The score often reflects that the LLM generated a *structurally* correct tool call, but the `OBSERVATION: Failure` is the true indicator of the outcome and must be the focus of debugging.

5.  **Agent Logic Should Be Self-Contained:** Deterministic agents should be responsible for generating the *entire* sequence of instructions required to complete a task. Prerequisite steps (like wrapping SOL) should not be handled by the test harness, as this hides the true complexity of the task from the agent and can lead to discrepancies between testing and real-world execution.
