# REEV IMPLEMENTATION REFLECTION

## Session ID Unification - Completed ✅
**Issue**: Multiple UUIDs generated across components causing tracking chaos
- Runner: f0133fcd-37bc-48b7-b24b-02cabed2e6e9  
- Flow: 791450d6-eab3-4f63-a922-fec89a554ba8
- Agent: 7229967a-8bb6-4003-ac1e-134f4c71876a.json

**Solution**: Single session_id propagation architecture
- Runner generates UUID and passes to all components
- Agent includes session_id in GLM and default payloads
- Enhanced otel creates unified file: otel_{session_id}.json
- Flow logger uses unified session_id for consistency

**Result**: Complete session tracking with single UUID flow

## Sol Transfer Tool Call Consolidation - Completed ✅
**Issue**: Each sol_transfer created 2 duplicate database rows
- Row 1: Initial call with input params, empty output
- Row 2: Completion call with empty input, actual output

**Solution**: Smart consolidation logic with time-based detection
- Detect duplicates by (session_id, tool_name, start_time) within 1-second window
- Merge input_params from first call + output_result from second call
- Prefer actual execution_time over 0ms placeholder

**Result**: Single consolidated row per tool execution with complete data

## Metadata Field Removal - Completed ✅
**Issue**: Unnecessary metadata fields cluttering codebase and schema
- Database: session_tool_calls.metadata column
- Structs: LogEvent, TestResult, FlowBenchmark, StepResult, EventContent, SessionLog

**Solution**: Comprehensive metadata field removal
- Removed metadata column from all database schema files
- Removed metadata fields from 8+ struct definitions
- Fixed compilation errors in test files and main code

**Result**: Cleaner codebase with 30+ metadata references eliminated

## SPL Transfer Address Resolution Regression - In Progress ⚠️
**Issue**: 002-spl-transfer.yml score dropped from 100% to 56% after context enrichment
**Root Cause**: Address resolution inconsistency between two systems
1. Context Resolver: Creates random addresses for placeholders
2. Test Scenarios: Derives correct ATA addresses based on those random addresses
3. LLM receives wrong addresses -> Creates wrong instructions -> "invalid account data"

**Technical Evidence**:
- Context shows correct derived ATAs in key_map
- LLM summary references correct addresses  
- But actual instruction uses wrong destination address
- Scoring debug confirms address mismatch between expected and generated

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Fixed context resolver to skip SPL placeholder generation
- ✅ Fixed environment reset to generate base wallet addresses for SPL
- ✅ Test scenarios correctly set up derived ATAs
- ❌ LLM still receives wrong addresses in actual execution

**Solution Strategy**: 
- Phase 1: Prevent random address generation for known SPL placeholders
- Phase 2: Ensure test scenario setup runs before context resolution
- Phase 3: Verify context-only tests work before surfpool integration
- Phase 4: Full integration testing to confirm 100% success rate

**Expected Outcome**: Return 002-spl-transfer.yml to 100% success rate
