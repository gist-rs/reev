## 2025-06-18: Cargo.toml Dependency Resolution

### **Problem Identified**
The project had multiple compilation errors due to missing Solana and Jupiter dependencies in the `reev-lib` crate. The workspace dependencies were defined at the root level but not properly imported in the individual crate's `Cargo.toml`.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Solana SDK crates (`solana-sdk`, `solana-client`, `solana-program`, etc.) were defined in workspace dependencies but not in the `reev-lib` crate's dependency section
2. **Duplicate Definitions**: Some dependencies were duplicated in dev-dependencies section, causing confusion
3. **Version Mismatches**: OpenTelemetry dependencies in `reev-runner` were using hardcoded versions instead of workspace versions
4. **Import Issues**: Removed necessary imports (`FromStr`, `SystemTime`) during cleanup attempts

### **Solution Applied**
1. **Consolidated Dependencies**: Moved all Solana/Jupiter dependencies to the main `[dependencies]` section in `reev-lib/Cargo.toml`
2. **Workspace Alignment**: Updated `reev-runner` to use workspace versions for OpenTelemetry dependencies
3. **Import Restoration**: Carefully restored only the imports that were actually being used
4. **Borrowing Fixes**: Fixed mutable borrowing issues in flow logger usage

### **Lessons Learned**
1. **Workspace Dependency Management**: Always ensure workspace dependencies are properly imported in each crate that needs them
2. **Incremental Cleanup**: When removing unused imports, verify they're actually unused across all contexts (including tests)
3. **Version Consistency**: Use workspace versions consistently to avoid version conflicts
4. **Tool Integration**: `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` is invaluable for catching and fixing issues systematically

### **Impact**
- âœ… Zero compilation errors
- âœ… All unit tests passing
- âœ… Clean build process
- âœ… Consistent dependency management across workspace

### **Future Prevention**
- Regular `cargo clippy` checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency audit scripts to verify workspace alignment
- Test-driven import cleanup to avoid breaking functionality
