Proof of Turso ON CONFLICT issue:

1. First sync creates 13 benchmark records ✅
2. Second sync should update existing records but creates 13 more (total 26) ❌
3. Our test route shows identical MD5s still create duplicates
4. Pure SQLite ON CONFLICT works fine

Conclusion: Turso library has a bug in ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE implementation.
