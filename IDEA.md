# üåä Reev Framework: Scoring System Validation & Testing Strategy

## üéØ Executive Summary

The Reev framework implements a sophisticated two-tiered scoring system that has been comprehensively validated across the full spectrum of possible outcomes. Our test suite ensures accurate assessment of agent performance while preventing false positives and differentiating between various failure modes.

## üìä Scoring Architecture

### Two-Tiered Scoring System

**Component Breakdown:**
```
Final Score = (Instruction Score √ó 75%) + (On-Chain Score √ó 25%)
```

#### 1. Instruction Score (75% weight)
Evaluates the quality of agent-generated transactions against ground truth:

- **Program ID Matching** (configurable weight, typically 0.5)
- **Instruction Data Validation** (configurable weight, typically 0.5)
- **Account Metadata Verification** (0.25 per account)
  - Public key resolution (placeholders ‚Üí actual keys)
  - Signer flag correctness
  - Writable flag correctness

#### 2. On-Chain Score (25% weight)
Binary evaluation of transaction execution:

- **Success**: 1.0 (transaction executes successfully on surfpool)
- **Failure**: 0.0 (transaction fails during simulation/execution)

### Scoring Formula Implementation

```rust
// From reev-lib/src/score.rs
let final_score = (instruction_score * INSTRUCTION_SCORE_WEIGHT) + (onchain_score * ONCHAIN_SCORE_WEIGHT);
// Where: INSTRUCTION_SCORE_WEIGHT = 0.75, ONCHAIN_SCORE_WEIGHT = 0.25
```

### Validated Score Scenarios

| Benchmark | Expected Score | Actual Score | Purpose | Validation Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| `001-sol-transfer` | 100% | ‚úÖ 100% | Perfect execution baseline | ‚úÖ Validated |
| `002-spl-transfer` | 100% | ‚úÖ 100% | SPL token success case | ‚úÖ Validated |
| `003-spl-transfer-fail` | 0% | ‚úÖ 0% | Complete failure (no instructions) | ‚úÖ Validated |
| `004-partial-score-spl-transfer` | ~50% | ‚úÖ 53.6% | Partial credit system | ‚úÖ Validated |
| `100-jup-swap-sol-usdc` | 100% | ‚úÖ 100% | Complex DeFi success | ‚úÖ Validated |
| `100-jup-swap-sol-usdc` (pre-fix) | ~75% | ‚úÖ 75% | Good reasoning, execution fail | ‚úÖ Validated |

### Test Case Analysis

#### 0% Score: `003-spl-transfer-fail`
**Purpose**: Validate complete failure handling
**Implementation**: Agent returns empty instructions array
**Result**: 
- Instruction Score: 0.0 (no instructions to compare)
- On-Chain Score: 0.0 (no transaction executed)
- Final Score: 0.0%

#### ~50% Score: `004-partial-score-spl-transfer`
**Purpose**: Test granular component scoring
**Implementation**: Correct program ID + accounts, wrong instruction data
**Scoring Breakdown**:
- Program ID: 0.5/0.5 (100%) ‚úÖ
- Instruction Data: 0.0/0.5 (0%) ‚ùå
- Accounts (3√ó): 0.75/0.75 (100%) ‚úÖ
- Instruction Score: 1.25/1.75 = 71.4%
- On-Chain Score: 0.0% (transaction fails)
- Final Score: (0.714 √ó 0.75) + (0.0 √ó 0.25) = 53.6%

#### ~75% Score: Jupiter Swap (Pre-Fix)
**Purpose**: Good reasoning with execution failure
**Issue**: Slippage tolerance exceeded (error 0xfaded)
**Result**: Perfect instruction matching, failed execution
- Instruction Score: 100%
- On-Chain Score: 0%
- Final Score: 75%

#### 100% Score: Standard Benchmarks
**Purpose**: Validate perfect execution baseline
**Implementation**: Correct instructions + successful execution
**Result**: Both components achieve maximum scores

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-False-Positive Protection

### Differentiated Failure Modes

The scoring system accurately distinguishes between:

1. **No Attempt** (0%): Agent doesn't generate any instructions
2. **Partial Attempt** (25-75%): Agent tries but makes mistakes
3. **Good Attempt, Bad Execution** (~75%): Correct reasoning, external factors cause failure
4. **Perfect Execution** (100%): Everything works correctly

### Granular Component Validation

Each instruction component is scored independently:
- **Program ID**: Ensures agent targets correct program
- **Instruction Data**: Validates specific operation parameters
- **Account Metadata**: Checks signer/writable flags and key resolution

### Weighted Scoring Prevention

Configurable weights prevent gaming the system:
- Critical components (program ID) have higher weights
- Multiple account validations ensure comprehensive checking
- On-chain execution adds real-world validation

## üîß Implementation Details

### Benchmark Configuration

Each benchmark defines weighted ground truth:

```yaml
ground_truth:
  expected_instructions:
    - program_id: "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"
      program_id_weight: 0.5
      data: "3Bxs4vKJW"  # Transfer instruction
      data_weight: 0.5
      accounts:
        - pubkey: "USER_USDC_ATA"
          is_signer: false
          is_writable: true
          weight: 0.25
```

### Score Calculation Flow

1. **Instruction Matching**: Compare generated vs expected instructions
2. **Component Scoring**: Evaluate each component with configured weights
3. **Instruction Score**: Calculate weighted average of components
4. **On-Chain Execution**: Simulate/execute transaction on surfpool
5. **Final Score**: Apply weightings to produce final assessment

## üìà Testing Strategy

### Continuous Validation

1. **Automated Testing**: All benchmarks run in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Score Verification**: Expected vs actual scores validated

### Manual Validation

1. **Interactive TUI**: Real-time score monitoring during development
2. **Debug Logging**: Detailed scoring breakdown for troubleshooting
3. **Database Persistence**: Historical score tracking and analysis
4. **Manual Review**: Periodic validation of scoring logic
