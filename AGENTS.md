- always diag after edit, fix diag, follow PLAN.md TASKS.md, update plan PLAN.md TASKS.md when complete
- remove what done from to TOFIX.md, add what to fix in TOFIX.md
- when fixed add reflect to REFLECT.md
- keep all md under 200 lines, keep only important and use short word, less noise.
- commit when done impl or fixed and run success result without error and warning with git convesion e.g. `feat:...`, `fix:...`, `refactor:...` when done for each task.
- run `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty`  before commit.
- don't add a test on each file, do add test to tests folder.
- prefer `match` more than `if`.
- use early `return` condition instead of `else`.
