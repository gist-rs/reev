# NOW: Setting Up the Project Structure

**Main Goal:** Complete Task 1.1 from `TASKS.md`.

The immediate focus is to initialize the Rust project with a proper Cargo workspace structure. This involves creating the parent `reev` directory and the two initial crates: `reev-lib` for the core framework logic and `reev-runner` for the application binary.

This is the first step in building the foundation described in Phase 1 of `PLAN.md`.
