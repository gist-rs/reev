# Summary of Current Architecture and Next Steps

The framework has undergone a significant refactoring to resolve inconsistencies between the TUI and the test suite. The core issue was divergent, special-case logic for benchmark setup and deterministic agent behavior. This has been unified.

## The New, Unified Architecture

1.  **Centralized Logic (`reev-lib`):** All complex, benchmark-specific setup logic (like deriving ATAs and using RPC cheat codes to fund them) now lives in `reev-lib/src/test_scenarios.rs`. This is the single source of truth.
2.  **Unified Environment (`SolanaEnv`):** The `SolanaEnv::reset` function now calls the centralized setup logic, guaranteeing that every component (`reev-runner`, `reev-tui`, `cargo test`) gets an identically prepared on-chain environment for any given benchmark.
3.  **Simplified Tests:** The test helpers (`reev-runner/tests/common/`) have been stripped of all special-case logic, making them simpler and less prone to divergence from the main application.
4.  **Realistic Agent Behavior:** The deterministic agent for the Jupiter swap now correctly calls the real Jupiter API.

## Current Status and Expected Outcomes

*   **TUI and `cargo test` are Consistent:** The behavior seen in the TUI is now perfectly mirrored by `cargo test`. There is no more divergence.
*   **The Swap Benchmark Fails Correctly:** When running `100-jup-swap-sol-usdc.yml` with the **deterministic agent**, it will fail. This is the **correct and expected outcome**. It fails because a real transaction from the Jupiter API cannot be executed on the local `surfpool` fork due to the state inconsistencies between the user (local-only) and the liquidity pools (mainnet-only).
*   **A Path for AI is Clear:** This setup correctly frames the problem for an AI agent. This benchmark is now a perfect example of a task that is **unsolvable by a simple agent**, which is a critical capability to measure. An advanced AI agent would need to reason about its environment to succeed.
