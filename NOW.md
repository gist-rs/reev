# NOW: Project Complete

This document outlines the immediate development focus for the `reev` framework.

## Current Objective: Maintenance and Future Planning

All planned development phases for the `reev` framework are now complete. The core features, including the hermetic evaluation environment, benchmark runner, TUI, and results persistence, are implemented and have been validated through integration testing.

The current focus is on:

1.  **Maintenance**: Addressing any bugs or issues that arise during usage.
2.  **Documentation**: Improving documentation and examples to make the framework easier to use.
3.  **Future Planning**: Scoping out the next major set of features or enhancements for `reev`. New work will be defined in updated planning documents (`PLAN.md`, `TASKS.md`) as it is decided.

The project is considered stable and ready for use.
