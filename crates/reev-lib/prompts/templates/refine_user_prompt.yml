task: "Refine user prompt into a series of executable steps for blockchain operations"

context:
  user_wallet_state: "Current wallet state with SOL and USDC balances"
  available_tools: "List of available tools and their capabilities"
  current_prices: "Current token prices in USD"

requirements:
  - "Analyze the user's intent and break it down into logical steps"
  - "Each step should be executable with available tools"
  - "Consider current wallet state and token prices"
  - "Ensure steps are in correct order for successful execution"
  - "Include reasoning for each step"

output_format:
  refined_prompt_series:
    step <integer>:
      prompt: "Specific instruction for this step"
      reasoning: "Why this step is needed and what it accomplishes"

example:
  refined_prompt_series:
    step 1:
      prompt: "Swap 1 SOL to USDC using Jupiter aggregator"
      reasoning: "User wants USDC, need to convert SOL to USDC first"
    step 2:
      prompt: "Deposit the resulting USDC into a liquidity pool"
      reasoning: "User wants to earn yield on the USDC"
