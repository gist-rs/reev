//! # Core Testing Philosophy: Surfpool + Real Mainnet Programs
//!
//! All integration tests in the `reev` framework operate on `surfpool`, a high-speed
//! local Solana test validator. `surfpool` instantly forks Solana mainnet, meaning
//! any on-chain account not explicitly mocked in the test setup is fetched live from
//! mainnet. This allows tests to interact with real, deployed programs (like SPL Token
//! or Jupiter) without any mocking of program logic. Test assertions are based on the
//! real outcomes of these transactions. This approach ensures that a passing test gives
//! a strong signal of real-world viability.

//! # Benchmark Sanity Check Test
//!
//! This test file ensures that all defined benchmarks in the `benchmarks/`
//! directory are valid and "solvable" by a perfect agent.
//!
//! It dynamically discovers every `.yml` file and runs a test for each one.
//! All complex setup logic is now centralized in `reev-lib`, so this test uses a
//! single, unified setup function (`setup_env_for_benchmark`) for all cases.
