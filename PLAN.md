- **RAG-Based Flow Agent**: Vector store integration for dynamic tool selection
- **Enhanced Tool System**: Jupiter swap and lending protocols with flow awareness
- **Real Jupiter SDK Integration**: Complete replacement of public API calls with local `surfpool` interaction

### 📊 **Production Results**
- **Complete Pipeline**: Runner → Environment → Agent → LLM → Scoring working end-to-end
- **Real AI Integration**: Successfully tested with local models and cloud APIs  
- **Complex Operations**: Jupiter swap + lend workflows executing flawlessly

## 🚀 Phase 16A: Smart Dependency Management (Current Phase)

### **🎯 Primary Objective**
Implement intelligent dependency management architecture that separates concerns and provides zero-setup experience for developers while maintaining clean component boundaries.

### **📋 Core Architecture Changes**
- **Component Separation**: `reev-lib` and `reev-agent` have no surfpool dependencies
- **Runner as Orchestrator**: `reev-runner` manages all external dependencies automatically
- **Starter Pack Distribution**: Pre-built binaries for instant setup without compilation
- **Smart Process Management**: Automatic detection and shared instance support

### 🛠️ **Key Features to Implement**

#### **Priority 1: Dependency Management Architecture**
- **Process Manager**: Centralized management of surfpool and reev-agent processes
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with automatic recovery mechanisms
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic detection of running processes to avoid duplicates
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper cleanup and graceful shutdown on exit

#### **Priority 2: Starter Pack System**
- **Binary Distribution**: Platform-specific pre-built binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic download from GitHub releases when available
- **Local Caching**: Store binaries in `.surfpool/cache/` for instant reuse
- **Fallback Building**: Build from source only when binaries are unavailable

#### **Priority 3: Smart Installation**
- **Platform Detection**: Automatic detection of OS architecture and platform
- **Version Management**: Check for updates and manage version compatibility
- **Integrity Verification**: Verify downloaded binaries with checksums
- **Extraction & Setup**: Automatic extraction to `.surfpool/installs/` with symlinks

#### **Priority 4: Process Orchestration**
- **Sequential Startup**: Start reev-agent first, then surfpool with health verification
- **Port Management**: Automatic port allocation and conflict resolution
- **Shared Instances**: Allow multiple runner processes to use same services
- **Cleanup Handling**: Proper termination of all processes on graceful shutdown

### 🎯 **Success Criteria**
- **Zero-Setup Experience**: Run benchmarks with automatic dependency management
- **Fast Startup**: Reduce startup time from minutes to seconds with cached binaries
- **Component Independence**: Clean separation allows independent testing and development
- **Developer Friendly**: Clear status indicators and automatic error handling
