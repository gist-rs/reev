## ðŸŽ¯ Current Development Focus

### âœ… Phase 18: Flow & Tool Call Logging System - COMPLETED
âœ… Implemented comprehensive YML-structured logging for LLM flow and tool calls to enable website visualization, enhanced scoring, and OpenTelemetry integration.

### âœ… Phase 19: Technical Debt Resolution - COMPLETED
âœ… **ALL 10 TOFIX ISSUES RESOLVED** - Complete elimination of technical debt across stability, maintainability, and code quality dimensions.

### ðŸ”„ Phase 20: Agent Loop Behavior Optimization (ACTIVE ISSUE)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Critical Issue Identified**
Local LLM agent failing to call tools in multi-step flows, causing benchmark failures.

**Problem**: In benchmark `116-jup-lend-redeem-usdc`, Step 2 (redeem jUSDC) fails because:
- Local LLM agent returns empty transactions instead of calling tools
- Agent hallucinates "zero jUSDC shares" without using `jupiter_earn` tool to check positions
- Deterministic agent works perfectly (100% score) - issue is LLM-specific

**Root Cause**: Agent loop behavior where LLM doesn't use available tools for position checking
**Impact**: Flow benchmarks fail with local agents despite working infrastructure
**Priority**: HIGH - affects production LLM agent evaluation

### ðŸ”„ Phase 21: Advanced Multi-Agent Collaboration (FUTURE)

Now that all technical debt is resolved, focus shifts to advanced agent capabilities:
- Agent orchestration and specialization
- Swarm intelligence patterns
- Distributed problem solving
- Enhanced performance optimization

### ðŸ”„ Phase 22: Enterprise Features (FUTURE)
- Role-based access control
- Advanced security features
- Custom benchmark creation tools
- Performance analytics dashboard

### ðŸ”„ Phase 23: Ecosystem Expansion (FUTURE)
- Additional blockchain support
- More DeFi protocol integrations
- Community contribution framework
- Plugin architecture
