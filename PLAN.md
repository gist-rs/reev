### ✅ Phase 23: Benchmark Management System - COMPLETED & OPERATIONAL
**Objective**: Create centralized benchmark management with database-backed storage

**✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED & PRODUCTION READY**:

1. **Benchmark Content Storage**
   - ✅ Created `benchmarks` table with `id = md5(benchmark_name:prompt)` and `content = yml_content`
   - ✅ Store MD5 hash of benchmark_name+prompt as primary key for efficient lookup
   - ✅ Upsert benchmark files on startup to keep DB in sync

2. **Test Result Enhancement** 
   - ✅ Added `prompt_md5` field to `agent_performance` and `results` tables
   - ✅ Store MD5 hash instead of full prompt to save disk space
   - ✅ Maintain ability to map back to full prompt content via benchmark table

3. **Runtime API Management**
   - ✅ Implemented `/upsert_yml` endpoint for dynamic benchmark updates
   - ✅ All benchmark reads at runtime from database (not filesystem)
   - ✅ Foundation for UI integration for YML editing capabilities

4. **Database Schema Updates**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE benchmarks (
       id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- MD5 of benchmark_name:prompt
       prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
       content TEXT NOT NULL, -- Full YML content
       created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   
   ALTER TABLE agent_performance ADD COLUMN prompt_md5 TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE results ADD COLUMN prompt_md5 TEXT;
   CREATE INDEX idx_agent_performance_prompt_md5 ON agent_performance(prompt_md5);
   ```
