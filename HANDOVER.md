# HANDOVER.md

## Current State - 2025-10-29

### ✅ COMPLETED ISSUES
- **#29**: API Architecture Fix - Remove CLI Dependency for Benchmark Listing
  - Fixed API server crashes when accessing endpoints
  - Modified `list_benchmarks` to use database directly instead of CLI
  - Added `get_all_benchmarks()` method to PooledDatabaseWriter
  - Server now stable, frontend loads successfully

- **#30**: Frontend API Calls Analysis - Identify CLI Dependencies  
  - Documented all frontend API calls on app load
  - Confirmed all auto-called endpoints are safe (DB-only)
  - Identified only `/run` endpoints should use CLI (expected behavior)

### 🆕 ACTIVE ISSUES
- **#31**: Verify Status/Trace Endpoints CLI Dependencies
  - Need to verify remaining endpoints don't use CLI unnecessarily
  - Priority: Status/trace/sync endpoints in handlers/benchmarks.rs, flows.rs, yml.rs
  - Status: Created, investigation pending

### 🎯 CURRENT ARCHITECTURE
- **API Server**: ✅ Stable on port 3001
- **Database**: ✅ Direct access for discovery operations
- **CLI/Runner**: ✅ Only used for intentional benchmark execution
- **Frontend**: ✅ Loads successfully without crashes

### 📋 NEXT STEPS
1. **HIGH**: Verify status endpoints (`get_execution_status*`) use DB only
2. **MEDIUM**: Check flow retrieval (`get_flow`) uses stored data
3. **MEDIUM**: Verify sync operations (`sync_benchmarks`) use file system + DB
4. **LOW**: Ensure all trace/log endpoints are DB-read only

### 🔧 KEY FILES MODIFIED
- `crates/reev-api/src/handlers/benchmarks.rs` - Fixed CLI dependency
- `crates/reev-db/src/pool/pooled_writer.rs` - Added get_all_benchmarks method
- `ISSUES.md` - Comprehensive documentation of fixes and analysis

### 📊 TEST RESULTS
```bash
# Health check - ✅ Working
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health

# Benchmarks endpoint - ✅ Working (no crash!)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/benchmarks
# Returns 12 benchmarks from database

# Agent performance - ✅ Working (empty but no crash)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agent-performance
```

### 🏆 SUCCESS METRICS
- **Zero server crashes** during frontend load
- **Fast response times** (direct DB queries)
- **No cargo conflicts** between API and runner processes
- **Complete frontend compatibility** achieved

### 📝 PLAN_API.md STATUS
Most of PLAN_API.md has been completed through the API decoupling work:
- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Shared Types) - Complete
- ✅ Phase 2: CLI Process Integration - Complete  
- ✅ Phase 3: API Migration Strategy - Complete
- ✅ Phase 6: Configuration & Deployment - Complete
- 🔄 Phase 4-5,7: Testing, Error Handling, Monitoring - Partial

The core goal of PLAN_API.md (API decoupling) has been successfully achieved!
