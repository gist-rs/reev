# HANDOVER.md

## Current State - 2025-10-29

### ✅ COMPLETED ISSUES
- **#29**: API Architecture Fix - Remove CLI Dependency for Benchmark Listing
  - Fixed API server crashes when accessing endpoints
  - Modified `list_benchmarks` to use database directly instead of CLI
  - Added `get_all_benchmarks()` method to PooledDatabaseWriter
  - Server now stable, frontend loads successfully

- **#30**: Frontend API Calls Analysis - Identify CLI Dependencies  
  - Documented all frontend API calls on app load
  - Confirmed all auto-called endpoints are safe (DB-only)
  - Identified only `/run` endpoints should use CLI (expected behavior)

### ✅ COMPLETED ISSUES
- **#31**: Verify Status/Trace Endpoints CLI Dependencies - **RESOLVED**
  - Verified all status/trace/sync endpoints use database-only access
  - Confirmed no CLI dependencies in read operations
  - All endpoints follow proper architecture: DB reads only, file system sync for benchmarks

### 🎯 CURRENT ARCHITECTURE
- **API Server**: ✅ Stable on port 3001
- **Database**: ✅ Direct access for discovery operations
- **CLI/Runner**: ✅ Only used for intentional benchmark execution
- **Frontend**: ✅ Loads successfully without crashes

### 📋 NEXT STEPS
1. **LOW**: Fix minor diagnostic warnings in flow_diagram_format_test.rs
2. **LOW**: Add integration tests for verified endpoints (optional)
3. **MEDIUM**: Monitor system stability under load testing

### 🔧 KEY FILES MODIFIED
- `crates/reev-api/src/handlers/benchmarks.rs` - Fixed CLI dependency (#29)
- `crates/reev-db/src/pool/pooled_writer.rs` - Added get_all_benchmarks method (#29)
- `ISSUES.md` - Updated with #31 verification results
- HANDOVER.md - Updated with latest completion status

### 📊 TEST RESULTS
```bash
# Health check - ✅ Working
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health

# Benchmarks endpoint - ✅ Working (no crash!)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/benchmarks
# Returns 12 benchmarks from database

# Agent performance - ✅ Working (empty but no crash)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agent-performance

# Status endpoint - ✅ Working (DB-only)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/benchmarks/test/status

# Sync endpoint - ✅ Working (file system + DB)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/sync

# Flow logs endpoint - ✅ Working (DB-only)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/flow-logs/test
```

### 🏆 SUCCESS METRICS
- **Zero server crashes** during frontend load
- **Fast response times** (direct DB queries)
- **No cargo conflicts** between API and runner processes
- **Complete frontend compatibility** achieved
