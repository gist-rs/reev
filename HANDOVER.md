# Handover Summary

## Current State: 2025-10-26

### 🔧 **Implementation Completed**

**Primary Fix**: Enhanced context format to resolve LLM confusion between initial and current states in multi-step flows.

**Files Modified**:
- `crates/reev-lib/src/llm_agent.rs` - Enhanced `LlmAgent.get_action()` method
- `reev/ISSUES.md` - Updated with progress and new issues

### ✅ **What Works**

**Enhanced Context Format Implemented**:
```
🔄 MULTI-STEP FLOW CONTEXT

# STEP 0 - INITIAL STATE (BEFORE FLOW START)
[YAML with original amounts]

# STEP 2 - CURRENT STATE (AFTER PREVIOUS STEPS)  
[YAML with updated amounts]

💡 IMPORTANT: Use amounts from CURRENT STATE (STEP 2) for operations
---
```

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Step-Aware Formatting** - Clear separation with visual indicators
2. **Explicit Instructions** - Direct guidance to use current state amounts
3. **Multi-Step Detection** - Automatic formatting when both states present
4. **Consistent YAML Structure** - Same format for both states

### 🐛 **New Issues Discovered**

1. **Issue #2 (RESOLVED ✅)**: Jupiter lend deposit amount confusion
   - **Fixed**: Enhanced context prevents LLM from using old amounts
   - **Status**: Implementation complete, needs production testing

2. **Issue #4 (NEW ⚠️)**: SOL transfer placeholder resolution
   - **Error**: `"Failed to parse pubkey: Invalid Base58 string"`
   - **Cause**: LLM uses placeholder names directly instead of resolved addresses
   - **Example**: Tries to use `RECIPIENT_WALLET_PUBKEY` instead of resolved `3FHqkBwzaasvorCVvS6wSgzVHE7T8mhWmYD6F2Jjyqmg`
   - **Impact**: Affects all operations requiring resolved addresses

### 🧪 **Testing Status**

**Completed**:
- ✅ Enhanced context format implemented and committed
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ New issue documented in ISSUES.md

**In Progress**:
- 🔍 Testing multi-step flows with enhanced context
- 📊 Monitoring LLM behavior improvements

**Next Steps**:
1. **Test Issue #4**: Investigate why LLM ignores resolved addresses in key_map
2. **Enhance Instructions**: Add explicit guidance about placeholder vs resolved address usage
3. **Production Validation**: Run full benchmark suite to verify fixes

### 📋 **Key Files to Review**

- `crates/reev-lib/src/llm_agent.rs` - Main implementation
- `reev/ISSUES.md` - Issue tracking and status
- `benchmarks/200-jup-swap-then-lend-deposit.yml` - Test case for validation

### 🚀 **Technical Debt**

- Consider adding more explicit placeholder resolution guidance
- Investigate if tool descriptions need enhancement for address handling
- Review context formatting for further clarity improvements

### 📞 **Contact Points**

Primary implementation complete. Focus should shift to:
1. Testing and validation of enhanced context
2. Resolution of Issue #4 (placeholder vs address confusion)
3. Performance monitoring and optimization
