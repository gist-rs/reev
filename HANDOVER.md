## Current State - 2025-10-29 (Updated for Issue #32)

### ✅ COMPLETED ISSUES
- **#29**: API Architecture Fix - Remove CLI Dependency for Benchmark Listing
  - Fixed API server crashes when accessing endpoints
  - Modified `list_benchmarks` to use database directly instead of CLI
  - Added `get_all_benchmarks()` method to PooledDatabaseWriter
  - Server now stable, frontend loads successfully

- **#30**: Frontend API Calls Analysis - Identify CLI Dependencies  
  - Documented all frontend API calls on app load
  - Confirmed all auto-called endpoints are safe (DB-only)
  - Identified only `/run` endpoints should use CLI (expected behavior)

### ✅ COMPLETED ISSUES
- **#31**: Verify Status/Trace Endpoints CLI Dependencies - **RESOLVED**
  - Verified all status/trace/sync endpoints use database-only access
  - Confirmed no CLI dependencies in read operations
  - All endpoints follow proper architecture: DB reads only, file system sync for benchmarks
- **#32**: Database connection locks + Session file feedback loop - **RESOLVED** ✅
  - Successfully removed all database operations from reev-runner
  - Implemented session file reading and feedback loop in BenchmarkExecutor
  - Added pre-built binary support to eliminate compilation delays
  - Confirmed end-to-end execution: session files created → API reads → database storage
  - Database lock conflicts completely eliminated between API and runner

### 🎯 COMPLETED ARCHITECTURE
- **API Server**: ✅ Stable on port 3001
- **Database**: ✅ Direct access for discovery operations
- **CLI/Runner**: ✅ Database-free, only used for intentional benchmark execution
- **Frontend**: ✅ Loads successfully without crashes
- **Session Feedback Loop**: ✅ Implemented and working

### 🎉 ISSUE #32 RESOLUTION COMPLETE
1. **✅ COMPLETED**: Session file feedback loop implementation
   - Removed all database operations from reev-runner
   - Implemented session file reading in BenchmarkExecutor
   - Added pre-built binary support for fast CLI execution
   - Tested end-to-end execution flow
   - Confirmed session files created and read correctly
   - Verified no database lock conflicts
2. **LOW**: Fix minor diagnostic warnings in flow_diagram_format_test.rs
3. **LOW**: Add integration tests for verified endpoints (optional)
4. **MEDIUM**: Monitor system stability under load testing

### 🔧 KEY FILES MODIFIED
- `crates/reev-api/src/handlers/benchmarks.rs` - Fixed CLI dependency (#29)
- `crates/reev-db/src/pool/pooled_writer.rs` - Added get_all_benchmarks method (#29)
- `ISSUES.md` - Updated with #31 verification results
- HANDOVER.md - Updated with latest completion status

### 📊 TEST RESULTS
```bash
# Health check - ✅ Working
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health

# Benchmarks endpoint - ✅ Working (no crash!)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/benchmarks
# Returns 12 benchmarks from database

# Agent performance - ✅ Working (empty but no crash)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/agent-performance

# Status endpoint - ✅ Working (DB-only)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/benchmarks/test/status

# Sync endpoint - ✅ Working (file system + DB)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/sync

# Flow logs endpoint - ✅ Working (DB-only)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/flow-logs/test
```

### 🏆 **SUCCESS METRICS - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**
- **Zero server crashes** during frontend load
- **Fast response times** (direct DB queries)
- **No cargo conflicts** between API and runner processes
- **Complete frontend compatibility** achieved
- **Database lock conflicts eliminated** between API and runner
- **Session file feedback loop implemented** and functional
- **End-to-end benchmark execution** working with database-free runner

### 📋 **OPEN ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES**

- **Enhanced OTEL Integration**: 
  - Currently session files created in `logs/sessions/session_{id}.json`
  - Enhanced OTEL available in `logs/sessions/enhanced_otel_{id}.jsonl` 
  - Can be enabled via `REEV_ENHANCED_OTEL_FILE` environment variable
  - Opportunity: Rich tool call tracing and performance analytics

- **Performance Monitoring**:
  - Consider adding metrics collection for execution times
  - Monitor session file reading performance
  - Database query optimization opportunities

### 📝 **PROJECT HEALTH STATUS: EXCELLENT**
- ✅ All critical issues resolved
- ✅ Architecture stable and functional
- ✅ Zero database lock conflicts
- ✅ Fast CLI execution with pre-built binaries
- ✅ Session file feedback loop working
- ✅ Frontend loads without crashes

### 🚨 **IN PROGRESS - Issue #32**
**Status**: **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - Architecture changes done, testing in progress

**Completed Work:**
- ✅ Identified database lock contention as root cause
- ✅ Removed database dependency from BenchmarkExecutor 
- ✅ Fixed database column indices in `row_to_execution_state()`
- ✅ Added `--no-db` flag to reev-runner CLI
- ✅ Implemented session file reading in `BenchmarkExecutor.read_session_file_results()`

**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Re-enable database storage in API handlers
- [ ] Test complete execution flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify session file parsing works correctly
- [ ] Confirm no database lock conflicts remain
