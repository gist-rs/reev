# Handover - Current State

## 📋 Summary
**Time**: 2025-10-27T12:45:00Z
**Status**: Address truncation fix completed ✅

## 🎯 Recent Critical Work
**Address Truncation Fix** - COMPLETED ✅
- Fixed context builder to send full addresses to LLM instead of truncated `...` format
- Fixed fallback account naming to show full pubkeys  
- Fixed state diagram generator to remove address truncation
- Fixed services logging to show full program IDs
- Removed parameter truncation that could affect addresses
- **VERIFICATION**: Both API and CLI logs now show full 44-character addresses

## 🔍 Current Issue Investigation

**API vs CLI Tool Selection Difference** - NEW ISSUE #16
- **API calls** to benchmark 114-jup-positions-and-earnings: 
  - Calls `sol_transfer` with amount=0 (self-transfer) → FAILS with "Invalid amount"
  - Should call `jupiter_earn` with operation=Both
- **CLI calls** to same benchmark: 
  - Correctly calls `jupiter_earn` with operation=Both → WORKS
- **Address display**: Both showing full addresses correctly after fix

## 📁 Key Files Modified
- `reev/crates/reev-agent/src/context/mod.rs` - Main address truncation fix
- `reev/crates/reev-agent/src/context/builder.rs` - Logging fix
- `reev/crates/reev-api/src/handlers/flow_diagram/state_diagram_generator.rs` - Diagram truncation removal
- `reev/crates/reev-api/src/services.rs` - Program ID truncation fix

## 🚨 Incomplete Issues
1. **API vs CLI LLM Decision Difference** - Priority HIGH
   - Root cause unknown - same prompt/context but different tool selection
   - Need to investigate request format differences between API and CLI

## 📝 Next Steps
1. Investigate why LLM makes different tool choices between API vs CLI
2. Compare request payloads sent to LLM in both scenarios
3. Check if there are different context building paths for API vs CLI

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- All address truncation issues resolved ✅
- surfpool.log file cleanup handled
- Build system working correctly
- Ready for next debugging phase
