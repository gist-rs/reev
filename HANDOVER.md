# REEV IMPLEMENTATION HANDOVER

## Session ID Unification - Completed ✅
**Issue**: Multiple UUIDs generated across components causing tracking chaos
- Runner: f0133fcd-37bc-48b7-b24b-02cabed2e6e9  
- Flow: 791450d6-eab3-4f63-a922-fec89a554ba8
- Agent: 7229967a-8bb6-4003-ac1e-134f4c71876a.json, 23105291-893d-4a58-9622-e02d41a6649f.json (multiple created)

**Solution**: Single session_id propagation architecture
- Runner generates UUID and passes to all components
- Agent includes session_id in GLM and default payloads  
- Enhanced otel creates unified file: otel_{session_id}.json
- Flow logger uses unified session_id for consistency

**Result**: Complete session tracking with single UUID flow

## Sol Transfer Tool Call Consolidation - Completed ✅
**Issue**: Each sol_transfer created 2 duplicate database rows:
- Row 1: Initial call with input params, empty output
- Row 2: Completion with empty input, actual output

**Solution**: Smart consolidation logic
- Detect duplicates by (session_id, tool_name, start_time) within 1-second window
- Merge input_params from first call + output_result from second call  
- Prefer actual execution_time over 0ms placeholder
- Add unique constraints to prevent future duplicates

**Result**: Single consolidated row per tool execution with complete data

## Metadata Field Removal - Completed ✅
**Issue**: Unnecessary metadata fields cluttering codebase and schema
- Database: `session_tool_calls.metadata` column 
- Structs: `LogEvent`, `TestResult`, `FlowBenchmark`, `StepResult`, `EventContent`, `SessionLog`
- Usage: Empty HashMap initializations throughout codebase

**Solution**: Comprehensive metadata field removal
- Removed metadata column from all database schema files
- Removed metadata fields from 8+ struct definitions  
- Cleaned up 20+ code locations using metadata assignments
- Fixed compilation errors in test files and main code

**Result**: Cleaner codebase with 30+ metadata references eliminated

## SPL Transfer Address Resolution Regression - In Progress ⚠️

### Problem Analysis
**002-spl-transfer.yml regression from 100% to 56% after context enrichment**

**Root Cause**: **Address resolution race condition** between two systems:
1. **Context Resolver** - Creates random addresses for placeholders
2. **Test Scenarios** - Derives correct ATA addresses based on those random addresses
3. **LLM** - Receives mixed addresses (some correct, some wrong) in context
4. **Execution** - Creates wrong instructions → "invalid account data"

### Current Architecture Flow
```
1. env.reset() → Generates random addresses for ALL placeholders
2. setup_spl_scenario() → Attempts to overwrite with correct derived addresses  
3. run_evaluation_loop() → LLM receives mixed/incorrect addresses
```

### Specific Issue
```rust
// RESET: Creates random addresses
USER_WALLET_PUBKEY → address_A  
RECIPIENT_WALLET_PUBKEY → address_B  

// SETUP: Derives ATAs from random addresses  
USER_USDC_ATA → derived_from(address_A)  ✅
RECIPIENT_USDC_ATA → derived_from(address_B)  ❌

// RACE: If reset runs again after setup
USER_WALLET_PUBKEY → address_C (overwrites address_A!)
RECIPIENT_WALLET_PUBKEY → address_D (overwrites address_B!)

// LLM gets inconsistent context and creates wrong instructions
```

### Evidence from Logs
```
INFO [reset] Generated new address for placeholder 'USER_WALLET_PUBKEY': DBGZHPxVD4hds2LjXw46keEuRpJjM5Gva3ciQMChmL7
INFO [setup] Set state for 8Yvk3sMeu615qH4FKmn2Ye35z3Kxo7S5yh2BkPQaRru6 with owner DBGZHPxVD4hds2LjXw46keEuRpJjM5Gva3ciQMChmL7 and amount 50000000
```

### Root Cause
Environment reset generates addresses for placeholders that test scenarios should control. But current logic allows generating base wallet addresses for SPL benchmarks, creating race conditions.

### Current Fix Status
✅ **Context Resolver**: Fixed to skip SPL placeholder generation  
✅ **Environment Reset**: Partially fixed - still generates base wallet addresses  
❌ **Integration**: Still has race condition between reset and setup

### Required Fix
**Split responsibility cleanly**:
- **Environment Reset**: Only generate SYSTEM accounts (fee payer), not benchmark-specific accounts
- **Test Scenarios**: Handle ALL benchmark-specific address generation (wallets + derived ATAs)

This eliminates race condition by ensuring clear ownership of address generation.

### Files to Modify
1. `crates/reev-lib/src/solana_env/reset.rs` - Line ~55
2. `crates/reev-lib/src/test_scenarios.rs` - Review setup ordering
3. Consider if additional coordination needed in `crates/reev-runner/src/lib.rs`

### Success Criteria
- `002-spl-transfer.yml` returns to 100% success rate
- All other SPL benchmarks work correctly
- SOL transfer benchmarks remain unaffected (still 100%)

### Implementation Strategy
Modify environment reset to only generate system-level accounts (fee payer) and defer all benchmark-specific address generation to test scenarios. This ensures test scenarios have full control over address derivation and eliminates race conditions.
